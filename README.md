# RightPrice

This application is my second own project. It is a WPF application using .NET Core, SQL database with micro-ORM Dapper.

RightPrice is a simple item reseller where an user can create his own account. The user can control his offers(create new/delete those which he already sold).
First list in the "Main Window" shows all the offerings currently availible. Second list shows all the offerings, which have the same name and compares their prices(after you pick an offering in the first list). 
This project was created to practice working with basics of SQL database (Tables, Store procedures). I also introduced myself to .NET Core and found differences between my first project which was done in .NET Framework.
I also practiced creating frontend of the application with xaml.

This project is finished. I can still fix a bug if I find one.

This application will not work or any PC due to SQL database working only on local PCs!
